Oh yeah
I was born for this
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Born for this
When I was young I climbed up too high
Just to touch the sun
On my mission, no prescription
Shoot for number one
Start a riot, won't keep quiet
I'm a ride or die
Heart is pumping, keep it coming
Better run and hide
Born for this
I was born for this
I was born for this, I was born for
I was born for this
I was born for this, I was born for
I was born for this
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Born for this
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Born for this
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Born for this
Feel that fever lightning strikes
Dangerous like dynamite
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Born for this
Born for this
I was born for this
