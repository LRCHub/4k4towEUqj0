[00:15.18] I'm checking my vital signs
[00:16.65] Drawing my battle lines
[00:17.69] Going to war again
[00:19.14] Feeling the rhythm inside of my chest
[00:20.79] All I need is just a pen
[00:22.47] I know I was born for this
[00:25.98] I know I was born for this
[00:38.98] 
[00:30.08] Don't care for the critics
[00:31.10] My words are like physics
[00:32.13] A force that they can't stop
[00:33.78] They just don't get it, I think they forget
[00:35.57] I'm not done till I'm on top
[00:37.26] I know I was born for this
[00:40.72] I know I was born for this
[00:53.72] 
[00:44.84] I believe, I believe
[00:46.82] We can write our story
[00:48.67] I believe, I believe
[00:50.51] We can be an army
[00:59.01] 
[00:52.55] We are the warriors, who learned to love the pain
[00:56.18] We come from different places but have the same name
[01:00.03] 'Cause we were born for this
[01:07.29] We are the broken ones, who chose to spark a flame
[01:11.05] Watch as our fire rages, our hearts are never tame
[01:14.86] 'Cause we were, 'cause we were
[01:16.91] 'Cause we were, 'cause we were born for this
[01:19.68] We were born for this
[01:30.18] 
[01:23.77] I've struggled for years and
[01:24.89] Through all of the tears
[01:25.81] I've faced the doubts I hide
[01:27.40] I never gave into my fears deep within
[01:29.02] 'Cause I heard my voice inside
[01:30.89] I know I was born for this
[01:34.26] I know I was born for this
[01:47.26] 
[01:38.42] I will never lose my voice
[01:41.93] If I cut out all the noise
[01:45.35] I know, I was born for this
[01:49.10] I know, I was born for this
[02:02.60] 
[01:53.21] I believe, I believe
[01:55.34] We can write our story
[01:57.10] I believe, I believe
[01:58.94] We can be an army
[02:07.44] 
[02:01.02] We are the warriors, who learned to love the pain
[02:04.67] We come from different places but have the same name
[02:08.31] 'Cause we were, 'cause we were
[02:10.14] 'Cause we were, 'cause we were born for this
[02:13.22] We were born for this
[02:15.63] We are the broken ones, who chose to spark a flame
[02:19.31] Watch as our fire rages, our hearts are never tame
[02:23.04] 'Cause we were, 'cause we were
[02:25.08] 'Cause we were, 'cause we were born for this
[02:27.60] We were born for this
[02:38.10] 
[02:45.18] These words that I write are for someone like me
[02:46.88] To know you're not alone
[02:48.55] The moves that you make ya they come with mistakes
[02:50.54] Don't ever lose your hope
[02:52.09] Just know, you were born for this
[02:55.54] Just know, you were born for this
[03:12.04] 
[03:01.61] We are the warriors, who learned to love the pain
